# Programming Concepts

## SOLID Principle
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. 

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code, promoting the use of inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be able to substitute for its superclass without altering the desirable properties of the program.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This means that it's better to have multiple small, specific interfaces rather than a large, general-purpose interface. This promotes a more modular and flexible design.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (ISP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
